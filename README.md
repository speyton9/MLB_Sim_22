# MLB_Sim_22

This is an update of the previous uploaded MLB Sim at https://github.com/speyton9/MLBSimulator. I made some minor gameplay adjustments but primarirly cleaned up
the messy code from the orginal. I still plan on making additional gameplay updates and clean up the code further.

This is a simple MLB game simulator for Fanduel that will run each game n times. The number of sims to run can be selected in main.py, and once you update the appropriate paths to import and export the CSVs, you just need to run from main.

As a default, I have included a play by play to print as the program runs but to speed and/or avoid crashing with a larger number of simulations(+1000), comment
out the print lines in game.py.

I have provided a sample input in Stats.csv and MLBsim.csv is the output.
